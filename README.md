## options

![extension options menu](./images/options.png)

The extension has many configuration options, such as:

- Having the night slider show at all times, even when the night light is disabled
- Disabling the status icon from showing
- Having the extension enable night light throughout the day
  - Enabling this will mess up your night light time settings because it periodically changes the night light schedule to keep it enabled all day
- Letting the night light automatically sync with your screen brightness
  - This feature only makes sense on some laptops
- Toggling the extension to appear in the night light submenu instead

## installation

Available from GNOME extensions website [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1276/night-light-slider/), make sure to enable Night Light under Settings/Display
